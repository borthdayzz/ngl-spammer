# NGL-Spammer

starhook is a minimal NGL Spammer that runs on NodeJS, python build is no longer maintained. Use C Version instead

# KEEP IN MIND, THE JS BUILD WILL NEVER BE OPEN SOURCE, IF YOU SOMEHOW DOWNLOADED THE SOURCE THEN IT IS A MALICIOUS BUILD
# Python build will be fully open and editable, the message template additionals are available.

## Features

- **Block Bypass**: spammer can still send messages even if you've been blocked.
- **Customizable Templates**: you can make your own message templates.
- **Personalization**: make your messages feel more personal by adding things like names.

### Additional Features

1. **Constant Bomb**: Send a bunch of messages with just one click.
2. **Custom Messages**: Write your own messages instead of using premade ones.
3. **Check NGL.Link Page**: Keep track of the links.

## Installation

- **Installation is automatic, all you need is NodeJS and you should be good to go.**
- /// HOW TO RUN ///
- Extract it to a folder, click on the address bar and type "cmd"
- Once you have terminal open then type "node main.js"
- **Packages will be installed automatically, no need for manual installation**

- ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

- However if you have issues with that, i'd recommend installing the packages manually
+ "npm install request"
+ "npm install fs"
+ "npm install readline"
+ "npm install axios"
+ "npm install node-machine-id"
