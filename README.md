# NGL-Spammer

boggle.cc (starhook.solutions) is a minimal NGL Spammer that runs on NodeJS, Python and C Version.

# KEEP IN MIND, THE JS BUILD WILL NEVER BE OPEN SOURCE, IF YOU SOMEHOW DOWNLOADED THE SOURCE THEN IT IS A MALICIOUS BUILD
# Python build is currently deleted, it will be back soon.

## Features

- **Block Bypass**: Our spammer can still send messages even if you've been blocked.
- **Customizable Templates**: You can make your own message templates.
- **Personalization**: Make your messages feel more personal by adding things like names.

### Additional Features

1. **Constant Bomb**: Send a bunch of messages with just one click.
2. **Custom Messages**: Write your own messages instead of using premade ones.
3. **Check NGL.Link Page**: Keep track of the links.

## Why we made this?
We created this to encourage NGL developers to patch it.
